The Arnhold Institute will host its second session of the Technology and Entrepreneurship Speaker Series on Thurday, May 4 2017 at 12:00 pm.  Our featured guest will be Mark Hurst from Creative Good. 

>Abstract: A great deal has been written and said about why is it so important for companies to give users what they want. While putting the user first is common sense, unfortunately, it is not common practice. Drawing on case studies in his book “Customers Included,” Mark Hurst will describe how “listening to customers” is often misunderstood, if not ignored outright, leading to great opportunities for teams that want to build innovative products with their customers at the heart of their value proposition.
