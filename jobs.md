## Causal inference postdoctoral 

The Arnhold Institute seeks to reduce health inequities via innovative research and products. We have an opening for a causal inference postdoctoral scholar to combine machine learning and econometrics approaches to health data. The position will focus on the scholar's career development by developing and executing a rigorous research program and developing new collaborations across healthcare. We have access to very rich (and large) health datasets that can be a significant career development asset. While the program will depend on the candidate but we anticipate the position to require 50% research, 25% writing, 15% career development, and 10% travel.

## Probabilistic graphical models postdoctoral scholar

At the Arnhold Institute, we seek to drive the next generation of Global Health impact through data-driven and open innovation. One of our core research goals is to discover the factors and their interactions that affect a person’s health outside the presence and absence of disease. We are seeking a **probabilistic graphical models expert** to model complex interactions between heterogeneous datasets (categorical, real-valued, unstructured text, etc.) Specifically, we are interested in modeling the interactions between large-scale “Big Data” (e.g. high-dimensional, regularly sampled, large sample sizes etc.) and small data (e.g. low dimensional, irregularly sampled, small sample sizes, etc.) Our ability to model and conduct inference on these complex interactions has the potential to be one of the greatest health-related discoveries.

## Product manager

The Arnhold Institute seeks to reduce health inequities via innovative research and products. We are seeking a product manager to build our global health product, ATLAS. The product manager will be the primary voice for our users to ensure that we build a product that is responsive to their needs. The PM must demonstrate an ability to prioritize and accomplish tasks with limited resources and can break down complex problems into steps that drive product development.
