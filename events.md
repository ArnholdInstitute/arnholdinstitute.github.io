A great deal has been written and said about why is it so important for companies to give users what they want. While putting the user first is common sense, unfortunately, it is not common practice. Drawing on case studies in his book "Customers Included," Mark Hurst will describe how "listening to customers" is often misunderstood, if not ignored outright, leading to great opportunities for teams that want to build innovative products with their customers at the heart of their value proposition.
