## [National Drinking Water Database](https://github.com/ArnholdInstitute/National-Drinking-Water)

The [Environmental Working Group](http://www.ewg.org) publishes [data about drinking water contamination](http://www.ewg.org/tap-water/).  We've scraped this data and put it into a relational database.  The results can be found on our [Github page](https://github.com/ArnholdInstitute/National-Drinking-Water)
