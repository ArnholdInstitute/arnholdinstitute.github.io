title: Causal Inference Postdoctoral
---

The Arnhold Institute seeks to reduce health inequities via innovative research and products. We have an opening for a causal inference postdoctoral scholar to combine machine learning and econometrics approaches to health data. The position will focus on the scholar's career development by developing and executing a rigorous research program and developing new collaborations across healthcare. We have access to very rich (and large) health datasets that can be a significant career development asset. While the program will depend on the candidate but we anticipate the position to require 50% research, 25% writing, 15% career development, and 10% travel.

## Responsibilities

- Contribute to a creative research program with a focus on causal inference, machine learning, and health.- 
- Lead and co-lead the publication of interdisciplinary studies at the intersection of causal inference and health.
- Work with domain experts to translate machine learning science into useful products.
- Travel to present at conferences and events to bring exposure to our work.
- Be an active community member to help grow the "causality in machine learning" community
- Lead and co-lead grant proposal preparation to advance the state-of-the-art of data-driven scientific discovery.

## Qualifications

- The successful candidate must be intellectually flexible with a proven track record of interdisciplinary work. We look for candidates who continuously step outside their comfort zone and work well with others outside their domain of expertise.
- Algorithmic experience with large-scale predictive and inferential models. This is not a theoretical position. 
- Experience with experimental design and statistical analyses related to the generalizability of statistical models (e.g. reusable holdout).
- Working experience with causal inference from observational data, demonstrated by publications and/or link to software
- A Ph.D. in computer science, statistics, or applied mathematics.

## To Apply...

Email the following documents to james.faghmous@mssm.edu with the title of the position in the email title (e.g. postdoctoral scholar, assistant professor, etc.)

- Share the link to the source code for one inference project on Github.
- Share what you deem your most important publication/report with a paragraph why you chose that paper.
- A 2-page CV.
- The names and contact information of two professional references.
